Recipe Website from The Odin Project

Okay, so I'm writing this before I even started, so I'm looking forward to how the project will go and what will I have to write after finishing it.

Edit: So I made it and skills i demonstrated is being able to link pages together, show images on pages including headings, paragraphs, links and lists. The current project was Recipe Website.
